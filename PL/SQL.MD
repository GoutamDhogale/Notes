PL/SQL
----------
PLSQL=SQL+Feature of procedural Programming(combination of Sql and PP)

* PL/SQL is a completely portable, high-performance transaction-processing language.
* PL/SQL provides a built-in, interpreted and OS independent programming environment.
* Direct call can also be made from external programming language calls to database.
* PL/SQL's general syntax is based on that of ADA and Pascal programming language.

Feature
--------
* PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL.
* It offers extensive error checking.
* It offers numerous data types.
* It offers a variety of programming structures.
* It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.
* It supports object-oriented programming.
* It supports the development of web applications and server pages.
* PL/SQL supports both static and dynamic SQL
* Static SQL supports DML operations and transaction control from PL/SQL block. In Dynamic SQL, SQL allows embedding DDL statements in PL/SQL blocks.
* PL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. This reduces network traffic and provides high performance for the applications.
* PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling, encapsulation, data hiding, and object-oriented data types.
* Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.
* PL/SQL provides access to predefined SQL packages.
* PL/SQL provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.
