<p>ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be accessed from any client including browsers and mobile devices. It is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.</p>


<h2><i>What is Web API?
</i></h2>

* <p> API is some kind of interface which has a set of functions that allow programmers to access specific features or data of an application, operating system or other services.</p>
* <p>Web API as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol. It is a concept and not a technology. We can build Web API using different technologies such as Java, .NET etc. For example, Twitter's REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write data using which we can integrate twitter's capabilities into our own application</p>
* <p>It works more or less the same way as ASP.NET MVC web application except that it sends data as a response instead of html view. It is like a webservice or WCF service but the exception is that it only supports HTTP protocol.</p>

  <h2><i>ASP.NET Web API Characteristics</i></h2>
  
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful services.</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Web API is built on top of ASP.NET and supports ASP.NET request/response pipeline</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Web API maps HTTP verbs to method names.</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Web API supports different formats of response data. Built-in support for JSON, XML, BSON format.</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Web API can be hosted in IIS, Self-hosted or other web server that supports .NET 4.0+.</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Web API framework includes new HttpClient to communicate with Web API server. HttpClient can be used in ASP.MVC server side, Windows Form application, Console application or other apps.</li>
